Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
-RDBMS is the actual database software, while SQL is the language we used to query through the RDBMS.

Why do tables need a primary key?
-A primary key allows us to specifically identify and query each table row.

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
-Foreign key.

What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
-We need a third table that contains the foreign keys to each table.
